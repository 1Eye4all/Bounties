# **Arweaveâ€™s Perpetual Open Web Hackathon**

## **Introduction**

Welcome to the perpetual, open permaweb hackathon!

At Arweave we firmly believe that the future ofÂ the [new web should be open source](https://medium.com/@arweave/towards-an-open-source-web-9ffe201fc044)Â for the benefit of users and developers alike. We want to help make this a reality, so weâ€™re rewarding developers like yourself for building open source dApps on the permaweb!

The Arweave itself is a global, permanent hard drive. The permaweb is a decentralised, immutable web built on top of the Arweave. Permaweb apps are built using normal web technologies â€” HTML, CSS, and Javascript â€” but are deployed to Arweaveâ€™s on-chain storage system, making them permanent and available in a fast, decentralised manner. You can get started and deploy a permaweb app in 2 minutes or less.

**Time investment:** One afternoon to one weekend.

## **Rewards:**

**Basic:** $50 in ETH + 200 AR
A simple application with functional features and a basic UI and styling, hosted on the permaweb. 

**Advanced:** $250 in ETH + 500 AR
A dynamic and interactive web application that is hosted on the permaweb, along with ideas that contribute added functionality to the permaweb eco system. For examples: [Arweave API explorer](https://arweave.net/LHff4F45o7ipDqjoePG0PDG5BD2hLD8xf17OBg4FjRE) & [ArweaveID](https://arweave.net/fGUdNmXFmflBMGI2f9vD7KzsrAc1s1USQgQLgAVT0W0). Ideas that resemble or improve on popular web applications such as [AskWeave](https://arweave.net/HhIjOjxgHYXJU5RVjRYfAR017vbZdujbCSlaA8NQ20U) & [Scribe](https://arweave.net/VOKAC_SYiUzbJrEaIY5SEBh1pf0bGQOd8c7G68nzet4#/) are also encouraged, and all applications must include a UI with basic styling.

**Store the UI for an existing dApp** on the permaweb: $100 in ETH + 300 AR

**Skyrocket with Apollo ðŸš€** Stand out from the crowd and build a show-stopping application with a killer UI to be in for the chance of entering our Apollo program. Apollo rewards you for building top-notch applications, by providing you with additional resources, rewards, and the chance to drive users to your perma-app. Weâ€™ll be keeping a close eye on submissions and if we spot a super-star build, youâ€™ll be hearing from us! 

If youâ€™re unsure of which category your application fits into, [head over to our Discord server](https://discord.gg/VxJ3xsm) where both Arweave team members and the wider Arweave developer community can help guide you with your submission ideas!

**Bonus Rewards:**

*Most innovative app:* Each month weâ€™ll be awarding a bonus $300 in ETH for the most ingenious and creative app that not only utilises the Arweave permaweb in a clever way, but is inspiring in its originality and vision. Itâ€™s the app that really stands out from the crowd, the star of the show if you will!

*Best team submission:* We believe that a collective intelligence can produce amazing results. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re awarding $300 ETH every month to the best team submission! Have an exciting app idea? Why not [join the Arweave Discord community](https://discord.gg/VxJ3xsm) and form a team? Or even invite your friends to help build out your idea! To make it worth your while, weâ€™ll add an additional $100 in ETH for each additional team member! GO TEAM!

*Best ecosystem contribution:* Weâ€™re looking for the best of the BEST ecosystem contribution. Weâ€™ll be awarding $300 of ETH each month to the community member who truly understands the communityâ€™s needs and builds a game changing app that significantly improves the permaweb experience.

*Refer a friend:* We value the Arweave community and naturally we want to share the Arweave initiative with the world, thatâ€™s why we want to incentivise you to refer your talented developer friends. For each person you refer that joins the perpetual hackathon weâ€™ll reward you AND your friend $10 of ETH. Simply @ your referrersâ€™ GitHub handle when you submit your application. 
 

## **Resources**

You can find the docs for getting started deploying your first permaweb appÂ [here](https://docs.arweave.org/developers/tools/arweave-deploy).

The docs for the JS library that allows you to read from and write to the permaweb areÂ [here](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave-js).

Weâ€™re providing some free tokens so you can get started building and deploying - grab your walletÂ [here](https://tokens.arweave.org/#/wallet). For guidance on how to use the Chrome web extension wallet, check outÂ [this user guide](https://docs.arweave.org/info/wallets/arweave-web-extension-wallet).

## **Rules**

We want to let you get started building your app without delay, so ideas for submissions are automatically approved. However,Â **only submissions that meet the reward criteria outlined below will receive a reward**Â - so please make sure you review them carefully and make sure your app complies with them. 

If we notice that your submission is unlikely to meet the reward criteria, we will try and let you know in advance, and are happy to offer guidance on how to tweak your idea to fit this guidance. [Holla at us](https://discord.gg/VxJ3xsm) on Discord! 

**[Check out ArweaveApps](http://arweaveapps.com) to ensure your submission is substantially different from existing applications on the permaweb!**

### **Successful submissions will meet the following criteria:**

- Submissions must beÂ **your own original work**, and must beÂ **unique or substantially different**Â from other permaweb applications or submissions to this hackathon.
- We are happy to accept forks of other applications, but the featureset must be substantially different or significantly expanded in the forked version.
- Apps must beÂ **open source, with the full source code available on Github or another open code hosting repository**. Feel free to use whatever OSS licence you prefer.
- Applications should beÂ **sufficiently complex**, as judged by the core Arweave team. For example, a simple â€˜hello worldâ€™ app is not complex enough to receive a reward. Broken/non-functional submissions will also be rejected. You should aim for a minimal viable product that an end-user could reasonably start to use.
- Your submission mustÂ **include a link to a live, functioning, and running instance of the app itself, as well as a link to the repository**Â it is stored within. It must also be published to ArweaveApps (see the submission process below)
- All applicants must **[join our Discord Dev server](https://discord.gg/VxJ3xsm)** and share your  submission in the **#on-the-arweave** channel upon completion 
- All submissions must include a **brief description** of the application and functionality in the GitHub repo
- If you wish to submit **more than one** submission, you are required to get approval from us before you are eligible to start a 2nd. Submissions are **limited to three** per developer, unless you are part of the Apollo program 

## **Reward details**

- We are currently offering rewards for up to 500 successful submissions in this hackathon
- The value of ETH to USD will be pegged at the time of transfer, which follows successful submission and provision of recipientsâ€™ ETH and AR addresses.
- Only submissions which are judged by the core Arweave team to meet all of the submission criteria will receive the rewards

## **The submission process**

- Click â€˜Start Workâ€™, and you will be automatically accepted so you can start hacking right away.
- Please note, submissions will only receive a reward if they successfully meet the submission criteria listed above. If you have questions, please drop a comment below and weâ€™ll be happy to help.
- Hack! Join us our tech Discord if you have any questions!
- Publish your app toÂ [ArweaveApps](https://arweave.net/35IFq9BcIgpSPti9YDYDiaQy4wMfMIKZ25t7hHZrhek). Also, submit a comment to the GitHub issue for the hackathon campaignÂ [here](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/Bounties/issues/1), containing a link to your appâ€™s repository, and a link to the live, running version of your app on the permaweb. You can generate a permaweb URL for the app by appending the transaction ID to this gateway link:Â [https://arweave.net/](https://arweave.net/)
- If you wish to submit more than one project, you will not be able to do so via GitCoin. In this case, you can submit an application by posting your build in the GitHub issue and provide a link to the live deployed app. We also recommend pitching your idea for additional submissions on [Discord](https://discord.gg/VxJ3xsm) before starting work.
- If your app meets the reward criteria defined above, we will release the reward!

## **App ideas**

This bounty allows you to build whatever app you like on top of the Arweaveâ€™s permaweb, but here are some ideas to get you started:

- Weavelist: A public mailing list and discussion app, similar to weavemail.app except open and unencrypted.
- WeaveDirectory: An index of weavemail.app users allowing short bios to help people find community members to chat to.
- ShowerThoughts: Submit short, interesting ideas to the permaweb, never to be forgotten.

Remember, weâ€™d love you to join us on ourÂ developersâ€™ [Discord server](https://discord.gg/VxJ3xsm) to chat, and get feedback and assistance with building!
