# Arweave’s Perpetual Open Web Hackathon

## Introduction

Welcome to the perpetual, open permaweb hackathon! 

At Arweave we firmly believe that the future of [the new web should be open source](https://medium.com/@arweave/towards-an-open-source-web-9ffe201fc044) for the benefit of users and developers alike. We want to help make this a reality, so we’re rewarding developers like yourself for building open source dApps on the permaweb!

The Arweave itself is a global, permanent hard drive. The permaweb is a decentralised, immutable web built on top of the Arweave. Permaweb apps are built using normal web technologies — HTML, CSS, and Javascript — but are deployed to Arweave’s on-chain storage system, making them permanent and available in a fast, decentralised manner. You can get started and deploy a permaweb app in 2 minutes or less.

**Time investment**: One afternoon to one weekend.

**Reward**: $200 in ETH + 500 AR. Cake and praise on our [dev Discord server](https://discord.gg/DjAFMJc) (not really, the cake is a lie -- but the community will probably love your build :D).

## Resources

You can find the docs for getting started deploying your first permaweb app [here](https://docs.arweave.org/developers/tools/arweave-deploy).

The docs for the JS library that allows you to read from and write to the permaweb are [here](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave-js). 

Check out some sample apps on ArweaveApps -- served right from the permaweb itself: [https://arweave.net/35IFq9BcIgpSPti9YDYDiaQy4wMfMIKZ25t7hHZrhek](https://arweave.net/35IFq9BcIgpSPti9YDYDiaQy4wMfMIKZ25t7hHZrhek)

We’re providing some free tokens so you can set started building and deploying - grab your wallet [here](https://tokens.arweave.org/#/wallet). For guidance on how to use the Chrome web extension wallet, check out [this user guide](https://docs.arweave.org/info/wallets/arweave-web-extension-wallet). 

## Rules

We want to let you get started building your app without delay, so ideas for submissions are automatically approved. However, **only submissions that meet the reward criteria outlined below will receive a reward** - so please make sure you review them carefully and make sure your app complies with them.

If we notice that your submission is unlikely to meet the reward criteria, we will try and let you know in advance, and are happy to offer guidance on how to tweak your idea to fit this guidance. 

### Successful submissions will meet the following criteria:

* Submissions must be **your own original work**, and must be **unique or substantially different** from other permaweb applications or submissions to this hackathon. 
* We are happy to accept forks of other applications, but the featureset must be substantially different or significantly expanded in the forked version.
* Apps must be **open source, with the full source code available on Github or another open code hosting repository**. Feel free to use whatever OSS licence you prefer. 
* Applications should be **sufficiently complex**, as judged by the core Arweave team. For example, a simple ‘hello world’ app is not complex enough to receive a reward. Broken/non-functional submissions will also be rejected. You should aim for a minimal viable product that an end-user could reasonably start to use.
* Your submission must **include a link to a live, functioning, and running instance of the app itself, as well as a link to the repository** it is stored within. It must also be published to ArweaveApps (see the submission process below). 

## Reward details

* We are currently offering rewards for up to 500 successful submissions in this hackathon
* Each reward will consist of $200 (in ETH), plus 500 AR tokens. The value of ETH to USD will be pegged at the time of transfer, which follows successful submission and provision of recipients’ ETH and AR addresses. 
* Only submissions which are judged by the core Arweave team to meet all of the submission criteria will receive the rewards

## The submission process

1. Click ‘Start Work’, and you will be automatically accepted so you can start hacking right away. 
1. Please note, submissions will only receive a reward if they successfully meet the submission criteria listed above. If you have questions, please drop a comment below and we’ll be happy to help. 
1. Hack! Join us our tech Discord if you have any questions!
1. Publish your app to [ArweaveApps](https://arweave.net/35IFq9BcIgpSPti9YDYDiaQy4wMfMIKZ25t7hHZrhek). Also, submit a comment to the GitHub issue for the hackathon campaign [here](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/Bounties/issues/1), containing a link to your app’s repository, and a link to the live, running version of your app on the permaweb. You can generate a permaweb URL for the app by appending the transaction ID to this gateway link: https://arweave.net/
1. If your app meets the reward criteria defined above, we will release the reward!

## App ideas

This bounty allows you to build whatever app you like on top of the Arweave’s permaweb, but here are some ideas to get you started:

* Weavelist: A public mailing list and discussion app, similar to weavemail.app except open and unencrypted.
* WeaveDirectory: An index of weavemail.app users allowing short bios to help people find community members to chat to.
* ShowerThoughts: Submit short, interesting ideas to the permaweb, never to be forgotten.

Remember, we’d love you to join us on our [developers’ Discord server to chat, and get feedback and assistance with building](https://discord.gg/DjAFMJc)!
